Hello,

I am working on a project for a Data Science bootcamp. Our task is to try to identify zip codes that would be particularly good for real estate investment based on historical single family home sale prices. 

My background is in Mathematics and Database management, so I don't have any domain specific knowledge about Real Estate Investment. From exploring your website, I see that your team has a single family home investment program and I am interested in learning more. 

Is there anyone on your team that would be willing to have a short chat with me about how people in your industry think about single family home investments? Additionally, any general information or resources that you are able to share would be much appreciated.

Sincerely,

Seth Chart
